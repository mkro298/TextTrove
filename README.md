# TextTrove 

scope: site where user can upload their textbook PDF and get a chapter-by-chapter summerization then generated questions + answers quizzing them on each chapter. 

timeline: deadline aug 20 

july 8 - july 12 - set up flask API backend with summ + q generation
july 14 - july 19 -  trouble shooting + debugging backend 
july 20 - aug 3 - front end 
aug 4 - aug 10 - fine tuning front end 
aug 11 - aug 14 - deployment + debugging

to do: 
    split up questions into q and a 
    handle UI for that 
    target different sections of the OG text rather than the summary (generate questions by chunk for the entire thing then finalize a certain number by randomly picking based on how many user wants)
    all of the UI stuff + creating pages and components
