# TextTrove 

A study tool used to upload textbook PDFs and generate summaries and flashcards on selected chapters. 

## Site Setup 
Run the following command to install all dependencies. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to start the site, both the backend and the frontend need to be running. 

Start by running the backend server with these commands. 

```
cd app 
cd backend 
python app.py
```

Then in another terminal start up the frontend by running. 

```
cd app
cd frontend 
npm run start
```

This will take you to the running site.
